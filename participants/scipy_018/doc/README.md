The PR_tutorial package contains some simple functions to demonstrate the process of creating and merging a PR request.

One function computes the factorial of a number:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

Another function computes the Fibonacci sequence:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
