Ok so I guess you are reading this cuz you wanna use my code. There are some
functions that do stuff.

The stuff is: 
    * Calculate a factorial
    * Calculate come fiboncci numbers


### Factorial Example

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9
### Fibonacci Example
    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
